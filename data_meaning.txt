Standard file:
Standard files are part of the GTFS specification,
which is a universally adopted format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information.

1. routes.txt:
This file defines transit routes. A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service.
The columns include identifiers for the route, descriptive names, and visual presentation details such as color.

2. shapes.txt:
Defines the physical path that a vehicle takes. This file is used to draw lines on a map to represent the routes.
Points are defined by latitude and longitude coordinates and are ordered to draw the shape.

3. stop_times.txt:
Specifies the times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from individual stops for each trip.
This file ties together trips, stops, and the specific timing of stops along a trip.

4. stops.txt:
Defines all the stopping locations along routes. Stops include various attributes like location, name,
and amenities (e.g., wheelchair boarding).

5. transfers.txt:
Provides rules for making connections between different routes at specific stops.
This can include minimum transfer times to ensure passengers can reliably make transfers.

6. trips.txt:
Describes trips for each route. A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occurs at a specific time.
This file includes details like trip identifiers, service IDs (linking to calendar.txt or calendar_dates.txt for operational days),
and operational details like wheelchair accessibility.

Non-standard file:
Non-standard files are not part of the official GTFS specification but may be included by transit agencies or
dataset providers to convey additional information that is specific to their operations

7. direction_names_exception.txt:
This non-standard file seems to provide exceptions or specific details about directions for routes,
including names and possibly operational details based on the direction of travel.

8. directions.txt:
Another non-standard file that likely maps directions (possibly inbound vs. outbound) to route IDs and short names,
helping to specify the operational direction of routes.

9. pattern_id.txt:
This non-standard file seems to associate trips with patterns,
where a pattern could be a specific path or set of stops that a trip follows, identified by a pattern_id.

10. stops_order_exception.txt:
A non-standard file likely detailing exceptions to the standard stop order for certain routes or directions.
This could include special operations or detours that alter the normal sequence of stops.
