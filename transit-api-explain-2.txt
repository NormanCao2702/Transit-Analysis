Endpoint 5: Get a List of Available Networks

This endpoint offers a comprehensive list of all transit networks available within the Transit system.
It's particularly useful for applications needing to present users with options for different transit networks,
such as city bus services, regional rail, or specialized transit like school buses. Optionally,
it can filter networks based on a specific geographic location, providing users with relevant choices for their area.

Key Parameters:

    1) lat and lon: These optional parameters allow filtering of networks to those serving a specified location,
    making the information more relevant to the user's current or intended position.
    2) include_all_networks: When set to true, this option includes additional networks that are typically filtered out,
    such as school bus services or previews of future transit network redesigns.
    This can offer a more comprehensive view of available transit options.

Usage:

    + Discovering Transit Options: Ideal for giving users a broad overview of the transit networks available,
    whether for planning trips in their current location or exploring transit options in a new area.
    + Filtering by Location: Enhances user experience by focusing on networks relevant to the user's geographic location,
    making trip planning more efficient.

Example Use Case:

+ An app user is planning a trip to a new city and wants to explore all public transit options available in that area.
By providing the latitude and longitude of the city center,
the app can fetch and display a list of all transit networks operating in the vicinity,
helping the user to understand their options for city buses, trains, and other forms of public transit.

How to Choose This Endpoint:

    Broad Transit Overview: Use this endpoint when you need to provide an extensive list of transit networks to users,
    either as part of an introductory overview of transit options or when exploring services in a new location.
    Geographically Relevant Filtering: Optimal for tailoring the list of networks to those that are operationally relevant to
    the user's specific location, enhancing the practicality of the information provided.

Endpoint 6: Get Detail for a Route

This endpoint is designed to provide comprehensive details about a specific transit route,
including its shape, itineraries, and optionally, the next departure time for each stop served by the route.
It's invaluable for applications requiring in-depth information about route characteristics and operations.
Key Parameters:

    1) global_route_id: The unique identifier for the route for which detailed information is requested.
    This ID should have been obtained from a previous API call, such as listing routes or finding nearby stops.
    2) include_next_departure: When set to true, enriches the stop list with the next departure time for each stop,
    offering a more dynamic perspective on the route's operation.

Usage:

    + Route Exploration: Enables users to explore the details of a specific route,
    including its path (shape) and the stops it serves.
    + Enhanced Trip Planning: Provides foundational data for advanced trip planning features,
    allowing for a deeper understanding of route options and schedules.

Responses:

The response includes detailed information about the route, such as:

    + direction_headsign, headsign, merged_headsign: Different ways of representing the route's direction and destinations
    for display purposes.
    shape: The route's path provided in the encoded polyline format, useful for mapping and visualization.
    is_active: Indicates if the route has any departures in the next 24 hours, helping to identify active routes.
    Route Attributes: Such as route_long_name, route_short_name, route_type, route_color, and route_text_color,
    aligning with GTFS standards for consistent route identification.
    canonical_itinerary: Marks itineraries considered as main or typical for the route,
    guiding users towards the most representative paths the route takes.

Example Use Case:

A user is considering taking a specific bus route and wants to see a detailed map of its path,
including where it stops and when the next bus departs from each stop.
By providing the global_route_id for this route and setting include_next_departure to true,
the API call can return all necessary details for the user to make an informed decision.

How to Choose This Endpoint:

    + In-Depth Route Information: Select this endpoint when your application needs to present detailed attributes of a route,
    including its operational characteristics and physical path.
    + Real-Time Departure Integration: Useful for adding real-time departures to the detailed route view,
    offering users a snapshot of the route's current operation alongside its static attributes.

Endpoint 7: Routes for a Given Network

This endpoint provides a list of all routes within a specified transit network.
It's designed for applications that need to offer users an overview of the routes operated by a particular transit agency
or network ,enhancing the discovery and exploration of transit options within a specific area or system.

Key Parameters:

    1) network_id: A crucial parameter that identifies the transit network or agency for which route information is requested.
    This ID can be obtained from the /public/available_networks endpoint.
    2) lat and lon: Optional parameters to improve the performance of the call by specifying a location served by the network.
    While not necessary for the request, providing these can speed up the response time.

Usage:

    + Network-Specific Route Exploration: Allows users to explore the routes available within a specific transit network,
    such as city buses, regional rail services, or even specialized transit operations.
    + Transit Network Analysis: Useful for developers and analysts looking to aggregate or
    examine route information for a given network, supporting tasks ranging from service optimization to user guidance.

Responses:

The response includes an array of routes with detailed information such as:

   + global_route_id: A unique identifier for each route that remains consistent across GTFS updates.
   + route_long_name, route_short_name, route_type: Standard GTFS attributes that provide names and type classification
   for the route.
   + route_color, route_text_color: Visual identifiers defined in GTFS that help with branding and user interface design.
   + route_network_name, route_network_id: Provide context about the network's branding and unique identification,
   useful for applications presenting multi-agency or multi-network information.

Example Use Case:

An app designed to provide comprehensive public transit information for a specific region wants to list all bus routes operated
by "BC Transit West Kootenay." By using the network_id obtained from /public/available_networks,
the app can fetch and display a detailed list of routes, enhancing user navigation and planning within the app.
How to Choose This Endpoint:

    Focused Network Exploration: Ideal for when your application or service is designed to
    offer detailed insights into a specific transit network,
    helping users navigate the routes offered by a single operator or within a defined region.
    Performance Optimization: By optionally including latitude and longitude parameters,
    you can improve the efficiency of data retrieval, making this endpoint well-suited for performance-sensitive applications.
